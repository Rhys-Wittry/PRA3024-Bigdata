So we collect data on the decay products, often called daughter particles. There are 524 [documented](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/listings/rpp2014-list-B-plus-minus.pdf) ways that the B<sup>+/-</sup> decays into various combinations. In order to simplify the process, we choose decay combinations that are convenient or have particular properties.\n",

        "We now have a histogram of events that we have reconstructed as a B meson. But some of these events are caused by a co-incidence of events which would still occur if there were no B mesons actually produced. We call this the background. Background and signal are indistinguishable now as the detector cannot tell the difference and our cuts were unable to remove the events for physics reasons. We can do some statistical analysis, if we know the approximate shapes of our signal and our background. Just like a least-squares fitting we can run a fit routine to minimise the error between the fitted curve and our data. As an example, if we know our data has an exponential background and a gaussian signal:\n",

        "\n",
        "Here the red line represents our signal, the blue dotted line is our background and the solid blue line is our combined curve. The graph also shows the number of signal events and the number of background events. The signal now is a tiny fraction of the total data shown in the plot.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to do this, we need to build a fit model, around which the software can try to fit our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use RooFit for this, which includes:\n",
        "* Gaussian\n",
        "* Exponential\n",

        "* Crystal Ball\n",
        "* Breit-Wigner\n",
        "\n",
        "As well as several other choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically exponential and Chebychev functions are used for background and Gaussian, Crystal Ball and Breit-Wigner are used for signal. We can also combine them (e.g. 1 crystal ball, 1 gaussian, 1 exponential) in various ways."
